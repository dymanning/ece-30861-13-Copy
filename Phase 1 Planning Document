Project: With your team, as part of your Phase 1 Planning Document, I encourage you to discuss each member's experiences in previous classes, internships, etc. with regard to:

Applying the engineering process in software engineering (Which steps are relevant/irrelevant? Which parts are confusing to you?)
The granularity of each iteration of the engineering process (How large have you tried? How small? What has worked or not worked in an internship or previous team project? How might you respond in the course project for this class?)
